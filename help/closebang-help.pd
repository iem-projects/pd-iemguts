#X text 108 39 emits a bang when an abstraction is deleted.;
#X text 41 76 [closebang] notifies you when an abstraction is about
to be deleted \, so you can:;
#X text 52 112 - cleanup ressources;
#X text 52 127 - keep track of instances (PUSH);
#X text 52 143 - say goodbye;
#X text 24 350 note: [closebang] requires Pd>=0.47;
#X text 38 172 [closebang] works well for deleting an abstraction in
a running patch.;
#X text 38 201 It works less well \, when closing a top-level patch
(but a best effort attemt is made);
#X text 39 231 As of now (Pd==0.48) \, [closebang] doesn't fire if
you just close Pd.;
